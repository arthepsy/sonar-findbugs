  There is a statement or branch that if executed guarantees that a value is null at this point, and that value that is guaranteed to be dereferenced (except on forward paths involving runtime exceptions).

  Note that a check such as <code>if (x == null) throw new NullPointerException();</code> is treated as a dereference of <code>x</code>.
