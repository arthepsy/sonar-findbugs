<p>
  The code calls notify() or notifyAll() while two locks are held. If this notification is intended to wake up a wait() that is holding the same locks, it may deadlock, since the wait will only give up one lock and the notify will be unable to get both locks, and thus the notify will not succeed. &nbsp; If there is also a warning about a two lock wait, the probably of a bug is quite high.
