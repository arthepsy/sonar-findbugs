<p>
  This method contains a self assignment of a local variable, and there is a field with an identical name. assignment appears to have been ; e.g.
</p>
<pre>
  int foo;
  public void setFoo(int foo) {
    foo = foo;
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The assignment is useless. Did you mean to assign to the field instead?
