  The code synchronizes on interned String.
</p>
<pre>
private static String LOCK = "LOCK";
...
  synchronized(LOCK) { ...}
...
</pre>
<p>
  Constant Strings are interned and shared across all other classes loaded by the JVM. Thus, this could is locking on something that other code might also be locking. This could result in very strange and hard to diagnose blocking and deadlock behavior.
