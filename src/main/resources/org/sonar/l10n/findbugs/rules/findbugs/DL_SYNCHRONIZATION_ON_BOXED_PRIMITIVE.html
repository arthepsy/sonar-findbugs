<p>
  The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Integer.
</p>
<pre>
private static Integer count = 0;
...
  synchronized(count) {
     count++;
     }
...
</pre>
<p>
  Since Integer objects can be cached and shared, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock
