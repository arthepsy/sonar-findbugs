  This code generates a hashcode and then computes the absolute value of that hashcode. If the hashcode is <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>, then the result will be negative as well (since <code>Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>).

  One out of 2^32 strings have a hashCode of Integer.MIN_VALUE, including "polygenelubricants" "GydZG_" and ""DESIGNING WORKHOUSES".
