<p>
  Array of covariant type is assigned to a field. This is confusing and may lead to ArrayStoreException at runtime if the reference of some other type will be stored in this array later like in the following code:
</p>
<p>
  <code>Number[] arr = new Integer[10]; arr[0] = 1.0;</code>
</p>
<p>
  Consider changing the type of created array or the field type.
