  This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance of a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses). Instances of these classes have their own concurrency control mechanisms that are orthogonal to the synchronization provided by the Java keyword <code>synchronized</code>. For example, synchronizing on an <code>AtomicBoolean</code> will not prevent other threads from modifying the <code>AtomicBoolean</code>.

  Such code may be correct, but should be carefully reviewed and documented, and may confuse people who have to maintain the code at a later date.
